<h1>Hello,</h1> 

Welcome to my Product design, for this test I utlise npm instead of yarn and also continued using Next.js; in order to set up your local terminal, you'll have to install the following. 

First you would need to install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Once npm has been installed:

```sh
cd client 
```
then:
```sh
npm run dev 
```
This will open the local host 3000, which will take you to the index page; in order to see the product page you'll have at add /product at the end of the URL.

Thank you for this amazing opportunity, thoroughly enjoyed designing the product page.
